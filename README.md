## Description
> Access a public API and successfully retrieve data from it;

I am using Storify's API to access instagram feeds of me and my family

>Display that data on a page:
I have used node backend(with express)

>Update the UI of a page without refreshing
I have intrepreted this as making this a single page application. 
So if you click on the top navigation elements , the page will not refresh

Do all of the above using only native JavaScript (no libraries such as jQuery, although CSS preprocessors are fine).
I have not used any javascript libraries. I have used SASS for css
